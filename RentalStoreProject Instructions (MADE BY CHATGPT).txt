Rental Store Management System

Project Description:
You are required to design and implement a rental store management system in Java. The system will manage a collection of movies and allow customers to rent and return movies. Additionally, the system will provide administrative functionality to add and remove movies, and generate statistics.

Classes to Implement:

1. Movie Class
- Fields:
  - title (String)
  - director (String)
  - releaseDate (LocalDate)
  - genre (String)
  - rating (Enum: PEGIRating with values PEGI_3, PEGI_7, PEGI_12, PEGI_16, PEGI_18)
  - availability (boolean)

- Methods:
  - Constructor: Initialize all fields.
  - Getters and Setters for all fields.
  - toString(): Return a string representation of the movie.

2. Customer Class
- Fields:
  - name (String)
  - membershipId (int)
  - rentedMovies (List<Movie>)

- Methods:
  - Constructor: Initialize name and membershipId.
  - Getters and Setters for all fields.
  - rentMovie(Movie movie): Add a movie to the rentedMovies list.
  - returnMovie(Movie movie): Remove a movie from the rentedMovies list.
  - getRentedMovies(): Return the list of rented movies.

3. RentalStore Class
- Fields:
  - movieCollection (Map<String, Movie>)

- Methods:
  - Constructor: Initialize the movie collection.
  - addMovie(Movie movie): Add a movie to the collection.
  - removeMovie(String title): Remove a movie from the collection.
  - displayAllMovies(): Display all movies in the collection.
  - searchMovieByTitle(String title): Return a movie by its title.
  - searchMoviesByDirector(String director): Return a list of movies by the same director.
  - searchMoviesByGenre(String genre): Return a list of movies by genre.
  - checkAvailability(String title): Return true if the movie is available, false otherwise.
  - updateAvailability(String title, boolean update): Update the availability status of a movie.
  - generateGenreStatistics(): Generate statistics of movies by genre.

4. RentalApp Class (Main Class)
- Contains the main method to run the application.
- Instantiate objects of the Movie, RentalStore, and Customer classes.
- Implement a console-based menu for customers to interact with the rental store system:
  - Register as a new customer.
  - Rent and return movies.
  - View rented movies and due dates.
  - Perform administrative tasks like adding/removing movies, viewing customer information, and generating rental store statistics.

Instructions:
1. Implement the Movie, Customer, RentalStore, and RentalApp classes as described above.
2. Use appropriate data structures to manage collections of movies and customers.
3. Ensure proper encapsulation and use of access modifiers.
4. Implement exception handling where necessary.
5. Write unit tests for the RentalStore class using JUnit and Mockito to verify the correctness of the methods.
6. Document your code with comments and provide a README file explaining how to run the application.
